# VRSpaceMuseum

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017) assignements.

## Versions

- Unity 2017.1.0p4
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0

## About:

Since the release of the newest Star Wars movie is near, I wanted to celebrate that, so my project is created under the umbrella of a Jedi Knight reconnaissance and spy mission. The data gathering is about the Empire, who decided to *use VR technology in trainigs and learning*. 

For this project I chose to research how VR is used in education and feature the information in key interactable access points, highlighted by a flickering blue light. 

Your mission: gather all the information and report back.

## Functionalities:
- double to pull out/ sheath the lighsaber
- tap on waypoints to teleport
- tap on interactable glowing elements to play the animation (video / sound)
